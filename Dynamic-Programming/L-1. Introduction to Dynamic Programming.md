### Ways of Solving a Dynamic Programming

1. Memoization Technique (Top - Down Approach)
2. Tabulation Technique (Bottom - Up Approach)

> **Note: Each and every problem should be solved first by Memoization, then optimized it by Tabulation and then further space optimized it**

### Nth Fibonnaci Number

- **Fibonnaci No**: A Number formed by the sum of its previous fibonnaci number and its second previous fibonnaci number
- The Corresponding Recurrence Relation for the same would be **`f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`**

#### 1. Recursive Approach

``` cpp

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int fib(int n){

    if(n <= 1){
        return n;
    }

    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}

int main(){

    cout << fib(5);
    return 0;
}

```

**Analysis of Recursive Solution**

If there are two recursive calls inside a function, the program will run the first call, finish its execution and then run the second call. Due to this reason, each and every call in the recursive tree will be executed. This gives the recursive code its exponential time complexity.

- f(5) calls for f(4) and f(3)
- f(4) calls for f(3) and f(2)
- f(3) calls for f(2) and f(1)
- f(2) calls for f(1) and f(0)
    - Here (n == 1) where the Recursion has met its base condition and now it will backtrack 

- f(1) returns 1 and f(0) returns 0 and hence 1 (1 + 0) to f(2) 
- f(2) returns 1 to f(3) and f(3) calls for f(1) which in turns is the base condition hence returns 1

**Observation:** 
- Here when we call for f(5), it calls f(4), f(4) call f(3) and eventually hitting the base condition and then backtrack
- The Problem with Recursion was once it has calculated a sub-problem say f(1) or f(2), it just returns the ans to its parent and never remembers it for later use and hence whenever it encounters the same sub-problem, it again solves this sub-problem which was of no use making a time-waste
- Here is what the first way of solving a Dyanamic Programming comes into picture **`Memoization`**

- Here the cases marked in yellow are called overlapping sub-problems and we need to solve them only once during the code execution

**Problems in the Recursive Solution**

- Solves the sub-problem on its each encounter thereby wasting a hell amount of time (Overlapping sub-problems)
- **Time Complexity: `O(2*n)`** (Huge Time Complexity)
- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`** (Auxillary Stack Space)

#### 2. Dynamic Programming Memoization Approach

**Steps to Memoize a Recursive Solution**

- Step-1: Declare a DP Array of size n+1 with all elements initalize to -1
- Step-2: Whenever we want to find the answer of a particular value (say n), we first check whether the answer is already calculated using the dp array(i.e dp[n]!= -1 ). If yes, simply return the value from the dp array.
- Step-3: If not, then we are finding the answer for the given value for the first time, we will use the recursive relation as usual but before returning from the function, we will set dp[n] to the solution we get.

> **Note: With the help of these three steps, any Recursion problem can be converted into a DP Memoization Type problem**

``` cpp

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int fib(int n, vector<int> &dp){

    if(n <= 1){
        return n;
    }

    // Step-3
    if(dp[n] != -1){
        return dp[n];
    }

    // Step-2
    return dp[n] = fib(n-1, dp) + fib(n-2, dp);
}

int main(){

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    // Step-1
    vector<int> dp(n+1, -1);
    
    cout << fib(n, dp);

    return 0;
}

```

**Analysis of DP Memoization Approach**

- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`** (Only distinctive n functions are called)
- **Space Complexity: `O(n) + O(n)`** (Auxillary Stack Space + Array)

> **Observation: DP Memoization Approach brings down the Huge Time Complexity of O(2^n) to O(n)**

---

#### 3. Dynamic Programming Tabulation Approach

- Tabulation is a ‘bottom-up’ approach where we start from the base case and reach the final answer that we want.

**Steps to convert Recursive Solution to Tabulation one**

- Step-1: Declare a DP Array of size n+1 with all elements initalize to -1
- Step-2: Find the Base Condition and its values
- Step-3: Iterate over for remaining conditons that are left after taken into consideration of the base case

``` cpp

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    // Step-1
    vector<int> dp(n+1, -1);
    
    // Step-2
    dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1;

    // Step-3
    for(int i=2; i<=n; i++){
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i+1];
    }

    return 0;
}

```

**Analysis of DP Tabulation Approach**

- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`** (Only distinctive n functions are called)
- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`** (Array)

> **Observation: DP Tabulation Approach cuts down the extra auxillary space for recursion**

---

#### 4. Space-Optimized Approach over Tabulation Approach

**Intuition**

- If observed, we are actually never required the entire dp array 
- All we required for a current n is its previous value and its second previous value
- So, instead of maintaining an entire array, we can simply maintain two variables say previous and second_previous and then update these two variable at each iteration

``` cpp

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int previous, secondPrevious;
    secondPrevious = 0, previous = 1;

    for(int i=2; i<=n; i++){
        
        int current;
        current = previous + secondPrevious;
        
        secondPrevious = previous;
        previous = current;
    }
    
    cout << previous;

    return 0;
}

```

**Analysis of DP Tabulation Approach with Space Optimization**

- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`** (Only distinctive n functions are called)
- **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**

> **Observation: DP Tabulation Approach cuts down the extra array space also**
