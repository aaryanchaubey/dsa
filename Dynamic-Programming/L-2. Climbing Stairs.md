# Climbing Stairs

### Steps to Identify a Recursive Problem

When we see a problem, it is very important to identify it as a dynamic programming problem. Generally (but not limited to) if the problem statement asks for the following:

- Count the total number of ways
- Given multiple ways of doing a task, which way will give the minimum or the maximum output

We can try to apply recursion. Once we get the recursive solution, we can go ahead to convert it to a dynamic programming one

### Steps to Solve a Problem after Identification

Once the problem has been identified, the following three steps comes handy in solving the problem:

1. Try to represent the problem in terms of indexes
2. Try all possible choices/ways at every index according to the problem statement
3. If the question states,
    - **`Count all the ways`** â€“ return sum of all choices / ways
    - **`Find maximum/minimum`** - return the choice / way with maximum / minimum output

### Problem Statement 

Given a number of stairs. Starting from the 0th stair we need to climb to the **`Nth`** stair. At a time we can climb either **one** or **two** steps. We need to return the **total number of distinct ways** to reach from **`0th to Nth stair`**

### Thought Process

- Step-1: Assuming all n stairs to be numbered from 0 to n-1
- Step-2: Standing on each stair (index), we have two options either to jump a single index or jump multiple indexes. We will try both these options at every index
- Step-3: Since we have to count the total number of distinct ways, we will return the sum of all the choices in our recursive function

> **The code for the problem in each approach will be exactly the same as that of the fibonnaci number question**
