# Introduction to Recursion, Recursion Tree, Stack Space

### What is Recursion ?

- A Function calling itself inside a function untill a specific stopping condition is satisified is called as Recursion

### Terminologies related to Recursion

1. `Base Condition`
- The Stopping condition in Recursion is called as base condition
- It ensures that the Recursion never exhausts the entire stack space letting the stack overflow 

2. `Stack Oveflow`
- If a function goes of infinitely calling itself therby exhausting the entire stack space, then the condition so occured is called as Stack Overflow

3. `Recursion Tree`
- A way of representing Recursion in a Tree format

Sample Code for Recursion

``` cpp
// Infinite Recursion (No Base Case Condition)

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void print(){
    cout << 1;
    print();
}

int main(){
    print();
}

```

``` cpp
// Finite Recurion (Presence of Base Condition)

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int count;

void print(){

    if (count == 3) return;    //  <- Base Condition 

    cout << count;
    count = count + 1;
    print();
}

int main(){
    print();
}

```
