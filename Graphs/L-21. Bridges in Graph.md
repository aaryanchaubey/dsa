# Bridges in Graphs

- A Bridge is defined as an edge which when removed makes the graph disconnected OR A Bridge is defined as an edge which when removed increases the no of connected components

### Knowledge about DFS Tree, Forward Edge, Back Edge

- Whenever a DFS is called upon a Graph, the DFS Function starts from its source node and then checks the adjacency list of the source node and selects the first node in the adjacency list which is not visisted by the DFS and calls DFS function on that node and this process continues until all nodes are visited by the DFS

> **Refer the Sample Graph below**

- Whenever DFS visits each node, it makes two kind of edges
    <br><br> 
    ` Forward Edges ` : Forward Edges are those edges which DFS uses in order to traverse from one node to another node thereby making a edge between two nodes
    <br><br>
    ` Backward Edges ` : Backward Edge is a edge which DFS skips or does not visits while traversing from one node to another because the current node on which DFS is present at that time of moment, its all adjacent nodes will already be visited by DFS and since it does not visit the node if it is once visited, hence, this edge remains unvisited

> **Due to this, post traversing the entire Graph using DFS, It makes a DFS Tree having nodes connected by forward edges**

### Significance of Back Edge

- A Back Edge connects a descendant to its ancestor (A node which is not a direct parent of descendent and it would atleast be a grandparent)
- A Back Edge is never a Bridge in Graph
    <br><br>
    > **Reason: A Back edge creates a direct path (a cycle) between its descendent and ancestor, but however, if even it is removed, then there is still an undirected path from the descendent to the ancestor (In terms of Bridge, it doesn't increases the no of components on its removal)**

Code for Finding Bridges in a Graph

``` cpp

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// findBridge Function -> returns a vector of bridges (edge between fromNode and toNode)
vector<pair<int, int>> findBridge(int currentNode, int timer, int parent, vector<int> adjList[], vector<int> &visited, vector<int> &tin, vector<int> &low){
    
    vector< pair<int, int> > bridges;

    visited[currentNode] = 1;
    tin[currentNode] = low[currentNode] = timer;
    timer = timer + 1;

    for(auto adjNode: adjList[currentNode]){

        if(adjNode == parent){
            continue;
        }
        else if(visited[adjNode]){
            low[currentNode] = min(low[currentNode], tin[adjNode]);
        }
        else{

            bridges = findBridge(adjNode, timer, currentNode, adjList, visited, tin, low);

            if( low[adjNode] > tin[currentNode] ){
                bridges.emplace_back(make_pair(currentNode, adjNode));
            }

            low[currentNode] = min(low[currentNode], low[adjNode]);
        }
    }

    return bridges;
}

// Main Function -> Driver Code
int  main(){

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Nodes: 1 based indexing -> Adjacency List: n+1
    vector<int> adjList[n+1];
    vector<int> visited(n+1, 0);
    vector<int> tin(n+1);
    vector<int> low(n+1);
    vector< pair<int, int> > bridges;

    int timer = 1;

    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){

        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;

        adjList[u].emplace_back(v);
        adjList[v].emplace_back(u);
    }

    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        
        if( !visited[i] ){
            bridges = findBridge(i, timer, -1, adjList, visited, tin, low);
        }
    }
    
    cout << "The Bridges Present in the given Graph are: " <<  endl;
    cout << "[ ";
    for(auto bridge: bridges){
        cout << "(" << bridge.first << " -> " << bridge.second << "), ";
    }
    cout << "]";

    return  0;
}

```

### Analysis

- **Time Complexity: `O(n + e) ~  O(n)`**   (n for visiting all nodes and e for visiting the adjacent nodes)
- **Space Complexity: `O(n + e) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n) ~ O(n)`**    (Space for Adjacency List, Visited Array, Tin Array, Low Array, Auxillary Space - Stack)
