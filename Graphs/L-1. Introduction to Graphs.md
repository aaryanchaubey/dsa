#  Introduction to Graphs

### 1. Definition

> **A Graph is a Data Structure which consists of a set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges**

---

### 2. There are Two Types of Graphs

- **Undirected Graph**: edge from (u, v) and an edge from (v, u) - both are same

- **Directed Graph**: an edge from (u, v) and an edge from (v, u) - both are not same

---

### 3.  Degree of a Vertex

- No of edges incoming and outgoing

- There are two types of degree -> Indegree and Outdegree

- ` Indegree `: No of edges incoming towards a vertex

- ` Outdegree `: No of edges outgoing from a vertex

- ` For an Undirected Graph : Indegree == Outdegree ` (since incoming edges and outgoing edges are same)

> **Note: The sum of all degree of vertices of an Undirected Graph is equal to twice the no of edges**

- ` For a Directed Graph: Indegree != Outdegree ` (since incoming edges and outgoing edges are different)

---

### 4. Path in a Graph

- For Undirected Graph: Path is a sequence of nodes such that no node is repeated twice

- For Directed Graph: If there is an edge from (u, v) then there is a Path from (u, v) but it doesn't implies to have a path from (v, u)

---

### 5. Cycle in a Graph : 

- If there exists a path from the start node which can be traversed in order to reach back to the start node again, then it can be said there exists a cycle in a Graph

---

### 6.  Some other Types of Graphs

- **Undirected Cyclic Graphs**: There exists a cycle in Undirected Graph

- **Undirected Acyclic Graphs**: There doesn't exists a cycle in Undirected Graph

- **Directed Cyclic Graphs**: There exists a cycle in Directed Graph

- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)**: There doesn't exists a cycle in Directed Graph

- **Weighted Graphs**: If the edges posses a weight associated to itself, it is said to be a Weighted Graph

- **UnWeighted Graphs**: If the edges doesn't posses a weight associated to itself, it is said to be a Unweighted Graph

> **Note : For UnWeighted Graphs - Assume the weight to be 1**
