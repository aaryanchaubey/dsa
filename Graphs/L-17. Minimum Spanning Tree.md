# Minimum Spanning Tree

- If a Tree can be drawn from a Graph consisting of n nodes such that the tree drawn has same `n no of nodes` but `n-1 no of edges`, then the tree so drawn is called as a Spanning Tree
- Now, out of all possible spanning trees that can be drawn owing to a particular graph, the spanning tree with the ` least sum of edges ` is called as the Minimum Spanning Tree

Refer to the figure below for clear illustration
