# Connected Components in a Graph

- Each and every Graph is made up of components
- The Figure given below is not a collection of 3 different Graphs but a type of Graph called Disconnected Graph which basically implies a single Graph consisting of 3 components

> **Note: Each Node of a Graph is also considered as a component**

### Pre-requisite before Graph Traversal Techniques
- In order to visit each component of a Graph, maintain a visited array
- Iterate for the number of nodes and mark a node visited while traversing thereby ensuring it is not visited more than once
- This is True unless and until it is mention that Graph has a single component

Sample Code for the above description

``` cpp

// Visited Array to keep a track of visited nodes
array<int, n> visited = {0};

// This for loop ensures that DFS or BFS will visit all components of the Graph may it be connected or disconnected
for(int i=0; i<n; i++){ // n -> no of nodes
  
  // If the Node is not visited, then DFS or BFS for that node will be called upon
  if( !visited[i] ){
    // BFS() or DFS() or anything else to be performed
  }
  
}

```
