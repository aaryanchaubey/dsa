# Kosaraju Algorithm

- Kosaraju Algorithm is an algorithm that finds the Strongly Connected Components in a Directed Graph

### What are Strongly Connected Components

- A Component is said to be a strongly connected component, if from each node, every other node in that component is able to be visited

---

### Intuition of the Algorithm

- Kosaraju Algorithm says that if we traverse the Graph via DFS in Normal Fashion starting from first node to the last node, we will not be able to find the strongly connected components as DFS will visit each node of all components in one go

- This can be solved by traversing the nodes from back to front (i.e. from last to first), In this case, DFS have to call itself differently for different components and it can't visit all nodes in one go

---

### Steps for the Algorithm

1. Sort the given nodes of the graph in a reverse order (This can be done by using Topological Sort)
2. Transpose the Graph (i.e Reverse the edge between every two nodes, For ex: If there is an edge from (u- > v), change that edge to (v -> u) )
3. Traverse the DFS for the nodes in order of Topological Sort

Code for Kosaraju Algorithm

``` cpp

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// TopologicalSort Recursive DFS Function -> returns the reverse order of the nodes
void TopologicalSort(int currentNode, vector<int> &visited, stack<int> &st, vector<int> adjList[]){
    
    visited[currentNode] = 1;
    
    for(auto adjNode: adjList[currentNode]){
        
        if( !visited[adjNode] ){
            TopologicalSort(adjNode, visited, st, adjList);
        }   
    }
    
    st.push(currentNode);
}

// DFS Function
void DFS(int currentNode, vector<int> &visited, vector<int> &SCC, vector<int> transpose[]){
    
    visited[currentNode] = 1;
    SCC.emplace_back(currentNode);
    
    for(auto adjNode: transpose[currentNode]){
        
        if( !visited[adjNode] ){
            DFS(adjNode, visited, SCC, transpose);
        }
        
    }
}

// Kosaraju Algorithm -> returns the vector of Strongly Connected Components
vector<vector<int>> KosarajuSCC(int n, vector<int> adjList[]){
    
    stack<int> st;
    vector<int> visited(n, 0);
    vector<int> transpose[n];
    vector<int> SCC;
    vector<vector<int>> allSCC;
    
    // Step-1: Reversing the order of nodes (Topological Sort)
    for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
        
        if( !visited[i] ){
            TopologicalSort(i, visited, st, adjList);
        }
    }

    // Step-2: Transposing the Adjacency List
    for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
        visited[i] = 0;
        for(auto transAdjNode: adjList[i]){
            transpose[transAdjNode].emplace_back(i);
        }
    }

    // Step-3: Calling the DFS Function on ordered nodes provided by Topological Sort
    while( !st.empty() ){

        int currentNode = st.top();
        st.pop();

        if( !visited[currentNode]){
            DFS(currentNode, visited, SCC, transpose);
        }

        if (SCC.size() != 0){
            allSCC.emplace_back(SCC);
        }
        SCC.clear();
    }

    return allSCC;

}

// Main Function -> Driver Code
int  main(){

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Nodes: 1 based indexing -> Adjacency List: n+1
    vector<int> adjList[n+1];
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){

        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;

        adjList[u].emplace_back(v);
    }

    // Call to the DFS Helper Function
    vector<vector<int>> allSCC = KosarajuSCC(n+1, adjList);

    // Printing the Path
    cout << "The Strongly Connected Components for the given Graph are as follows: " << endl;
    for(auto component: allSCC){

        cout << "[ ";
        for(auto node: component){
            cout << node << ", ";
        }
        cout << "]" << endl;
    }

    return  0;
}

```

### Analysis

- **Time Complexity: `O(n + e) + O(n + e) + O(n + e) ~ O(n + e)`** (n+e for topological sort, n+e for transpose of adjacency list, n+e for DFS)
- **Space Complexity: ` O(n + e) + O(n) + O(n) ~ O(n)`** (n + e for transpose, n for visited, Auxillary Space: Stack)
