# Kruskal's Algorithm

- Kruskal's Algorithm is a algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree out of all the possible spanning tree owing to a particular graph
- It follows a set of steps (Greedy way) in order to find the minimum spanning tree

---

### Intuition of the Algorithm

- It selects the minimum weighted edge out of all edges present in edgeList
- Further it checks the absolute parent of those two nodes which is going to be joined by that edge
- If absolute parent of both the nodes comes out to be same, then it ignores the edge and selects the next minimum edge
  Else It performs union operation on two nodes letting one to the absolute parent of other
- It Repeats this process of selecting the most minimum edge again and again untill all the edges in the edgeList are visited

---

### Steps for the Algorithm

1. Initialise an edgeList to store edge pair and its corresponding weight
2. Sort the edgeList as per weight of individual edge
3. Select the top edge as it will be the minimum edge out of all edges
4. Check for the absolute parent of nodes which were going to be connected by this minimum weighted edge
5. If absolute parent of both the nodes founds to be same, ignore the given edge as it will result in a cycle
   Else find the union of those two nodes
6. Go to Step 3 and repeat the processs until all the edges of the edgeList is visited;

### Optimized Approach (Using Union by Rank and Path Compression for Disjoint Set)

``` cpp

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Find Operation - Finding Parent using Path Compression
int find(int currentNode, vector<pair<int, int>> &disjoint){

    int parent = disjoint[currentNode].first;
    int rank = disjoint[currentNode].second;

    if (parent == -1){
        return currentNode;
    }
    else{
        return parent =  find(parent, disjoint);
    }
}

// Find Union - Finding Union by Rank
void unionSet(int fromNode, int toNode, vector<pair<int, int>> &disjoint){

    int fromRank = disjoint[fromNode].second;
    int toRank = disjoint[toNode].second;
    
    if (fromRank > toRank){
        disjoint[toNode].first = fromNode;
    }
    else if(toRank > fromRank){
        disjoint[fromNode].first = toNode;
    }
    else{
        disjoint[fromNode].first = toNode;
        disjoint[toNode].second = disjoint[toNode].second + 1;
    }
}

// Kruskal Algorithm
pair<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> Kruskal(vector< pair<int, pair<int, int>> > &edgeList, vector< pair<int, int> > &disjoint){
    
    // Sorting the edges 
    sort(edgeList.begin(), edgeList.end());
    
    vector< pair<int, int> > MST;
    int mstCost = 0;

    for(auto edge: edgeList){

        int edgeWeight = edge.first;
        int fromNode = edge.second.first;
        int toNode = edge.second.second;

        int firstParent = find(fromNode, disjoint);
        int secondParent = find(toNode, disjoint);

        if ( firstParent != secondParent ){
            mstCost = mstCost + edgeWeight;
            MST.emplace_back(make_pair(fromNode, toNode));
            unionSet(firstParent, secondParent, disjoint);
        }
    }

    // Returning the MST Cost and MST
    pair<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> ans;
    ans.first = mstCost;
    ans.second = MST;

    return ans;
}
    

// Main Function -> Driver Code
int main(){

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    vector< pair<int, int> > disjoint(n, make_pair(-1, 0));
    vector< pair<int, pair<int, int>> > edgeList;
    
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){

        int w, u, v;
        cin >> w >> u >> v;

        edgeList.emplace_back(make_pair(w, make_pair(u, v)));
    }
    
    pair<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> ans = Kruskal(edgeList, disjoint);

    // Printing Minium Spanning Tree Cost
    cout << "The Minimum Spanning Tree Cost is " << ans.first << endl;
    
    // Priniting Minimum Spanning Tree Edges
    cout << "The Edges of the Minium Spanning Tree are: " <<  endl;
    cout << "[ ";
    for(auto edge: ans.second){
        cout << "(" << edge.first << " -> " << edge.second << "), ";
    }
    cout << "]" << endl;

    return  0;
}

```

### Analysis of Optimized Approach
- **Time Complexity: ` O(mlogm)`**   (There are m edges and sorting them requires mlogm time)
- **Space Complexity: ` O(n + e) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n) ~ O(n)`**   (n + e for edgeList, n + e for disjointSet, n for MST)
