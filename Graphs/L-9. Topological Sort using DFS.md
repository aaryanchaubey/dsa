# Topological Sort using DFS

- It is a linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge from (u -> v) then u appears before v in that ordering

--- 

### Constraints for Topological Sorting

- The Graph should be a ` Directed Acyclic Graph `

> Reason for Directed Graph
> - If the Graph is an Undirected Graph and if there is an edge from (u -> v), then there will be also an edge from (v -> u). Hence, It will be not clear whether u should come before v or v should come before u

> Reason for Acyclic Graph
> - If the Graph is a Cyclic Graph, there exists dependency among the vertices again creating a confusion of which vertex should come before which vertex. Refer to the Sample Graph Below <br>

> - There is an edge from (2 -> 3) that implies 2 should come before 3
> - Next, There is an edge from (3 -> 4) which implies 3 should come before 4
> - So till now, the order of vertices is (2 -> 3 -> 4) which is satisfying the Topological Sorting constraints
> - But now, since there is also an edge from (4 -> 2) which says 4 should come before 2 but this results in misordering of previous order

Code for Topological Sort using DFS

``` cpp

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// TopologicalSort Recursive DFS Function
void TopologicalSort(int currentNode, vector<int> &visited, stack<int> &st, vector<int> adjList[]){
    
    visited[currentNode] = 1;
    
    for(auto adjNode: adjList[currentNode]){
        
        if( !visited[adjNode] ){
            TopologicalSort(adjNode, visited, st, adjList);
        }   
    }
    
    st.push(currentNode);
}

// TopologicalSort Helper Function -> Calls the TopologicalSort Recursive Function and returns the Path by DFS Traversal
vector<int> topoSortHelper(int n, vector<int> adjList[]){
    
    stack<int> st;
    vector<int> visited(n, 0);
    
    for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
        
        if( !visited[i] ){
            TopologicalSort(i, visited, st, adjList);
        }
        
    }
    
    vector<int> topoSort;
    while( !st.empty() ){
        topoSort.emplace_back(st.top());
        st.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;

    return topoSort;
    
}

// Main Function -> Driver Code
int  main(){

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Nodes: 1 based indexing -> Adjacency List: n+1
    vector<int> adjList[n+1];
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){

        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;

        adjList[u].emplace_back(v);
    }

    // Call to the DFS Helper Function
    vector<int> topoSort = topoSortHelper(n+1, adjList);

    // Printing the Path
    cout << "The Topological Sort for the given Graph is: ";
    for(auto node: topoSort){
        cout << node << " -> " << " ";
    }

    return  0;
}

```

### Analysis

- **Time Complexity: `O(n + e) ~  O(n)`**   (n for visiting all nodes and e for visiting the adjacent nodes)
- **Space Complexity: `O(n + e) + O(n) + O(n) ~ O(n)`**    (Space for Adjacency List, Visited Array, Auxillary Space - Stack)
