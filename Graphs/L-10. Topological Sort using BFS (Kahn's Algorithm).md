# Topological Sort using BFS (Kahn's Algorithm)

- It is a linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge from (u -> v) then u appears before v in that ordering

---

### Constraints for Topological Sorting

- The Graph should be a ` Directed Acyclic Graph `

> Reason for Directed Graph
> - If the Graph is an Undirected Graph and if there is an edge from (u -> v), then there will be also an edge from (v -> u). Hence, It will be not clear whether u should come before v or v should come before u

> Reason for Acyclic Graph
> - If the Graph is a Cyclic Graph, there exists dependency among the vertices again creating a confusion of which vertex should come before which vertex. Refer to the Sample Graph Below <br>

> - There is an edge from (2 -> 3) that implies 2 should come before 3
> - Next, There is an edge from (3 -> 4) which implies 3 should come before 4
> - So till now, the order of vertices is (2 -> 3 -> 4) which is satisfying the Topological Sorting constraints
> - But now, since there is also an edge from (4 -> 2) which says 4 should come before 2 but this results in misordering of previous order

### Intuition behind Kahn's Algorithm

- In a Topological Sort, we order the vertices in such a way that if there exists an edge from (u -> v), then u should appear before v
- Refering the sample figure below <br>

- One of the Valid Topological Sort for the above Graph is (4 -> 5 -> 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1)
- Since 4 is at beginning, it means there is not a single edge incoming to 4 because if there was an edge from any vertex incoming to 4, then that vertex would have been appear before 4 <br> The same is True for vertex 5
- So, Kahn noticed that vertex having indegree 0 will be the vertices that will appear first in the topological sort
- This is the Intuition behind the Topological Sort

> Reason for Maintaining the Indegree array and reducing it by one
> - Whenever a vertex is removed from the Graph, then all of its outgoing edges which are incoming edges contributing to the indegree of a vertex are affected, Hence, the vertex which was connected to the removed vertex will have degree one lesser because it's dependency had got decreased by removing that node

### Code for Topological Sort using BFS (Kahn's Algorithm)

``` cpp


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Kahn's Algorithm using BFS For finding Topological Sort
vector<int> topologicalSortBFSKahn(int n, vector<int> adjList[]){

    queue<int> q;
    vector<int> inDegree(n, 0);

    // Finding the Indegree of each vertex
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        for(auto adjNode: adjList[i]){
            inDegree[adjNode] = inDegree[adjNode] + 1;
        }
    }

    // Pushing the vertices having indegree 0
    for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
        if (inDegree[i] == 0){
            q.push(i);
        }
    }

    vector<int> topoSort;
    while( !q.empty() ){
        
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        topoSort.emplace_back(node);

        for(auto adjNode: adjList[node]){

            inDegree[adjNode] = inDegree[adjNode] - 1;
            if(inDegree[adjNode] == 0){
                q.push(adjNode);
            }

        }
    }

    return topoSort;
}

// Main Function -> Driver Code
int  main(){

    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Nodes: 1 based indexing -> Adjacency List: n+1
    vector<int> adjList[n+1];
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){

        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;

        adjList[u].emplace_back(v);
    }

    // Call to the DFS Helper Function
    vector<int> topoSort = topologicalSortBFSKahn(n+1, adjList);

    // Printing the Path
    cout << "The Topological Sort for the given Graph is: ";
    for(auto node: topoSort){
        cout << node << " -> " << " ";
    }

    return  0;
}

```

### Analysis

- **Time Complexity: `O(n + e) ~  O(n)`**   (n for visiting all nodes and e for visiting the adjacent nodes)
- **Space Complexity: `O(n + e) + O(n) + O(n) ~ O(n)`**    (Space for Adjacency List, Visited Array, Queue)
