# Representation of Linked List in CPP

- A Linked List is a Data Structure which consists of Nodes that are linked to each other
- Each node of a Linked List has two main components in it
- The first component is the `data` and the second component is the `address` of the next node
- Data in a linked list can be of anytype - it may be inbuilt data type (like int, char, float, double, bool) or user defined data type
- Address in a linked list is the one which is responsible for connecting two nodes thereby creating a linked list

CPP Representation

``` cpp

struct Node{
    int data;           // Data Part
    Node* next;         // Address of the next node
};

```

> **Note: The address of the First Node is stored in a special Node called as Head which only consists of address part**
